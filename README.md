Iris Classification Perceptron
Project Description
This project implements a perceptron algorithm using the delta rule to classify the Iris dataset. The goal is to distinguish the Iris-setosa class from the other two classes (merged into one common class Iris-not-setosa).

Data
-
Training Data: iris_training.txt
Test Data: iris_test.txt

Assumptions
-
The decision attribute (class label) is located in the last column.
All other attributes are numeric.
The program should handle any number of conditional attributes.

Functionality
-
Data Reading: The program reads data from the provided text files.

Perceptron Training: Trains a perceptron to distinguish the Iris-setosa class from the other two classes using the delta rule.

Testing: Tests the trained perceptron on the test dataset and prints the number of correctly classified examples and the accuracy of the experiment expressed as a percentage.

Manual Input: Allows for manual input of attribute vectors and prints the classification result for such vectors.
